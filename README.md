Gotz ETL is replaced with much faster and easy to use **Scoopi Web Scraper**
 
The XML definiton files of Gotz is complex and Scoopi replaces it with much simpler YAML configuration

- compare [Gotz XML def](https://github.com/maithilish/gotz/blob/master/src/main/resources/defs/examples/jsoup/ex-1/job.xml) with [Scoopi YAML def](https://github.com/maithilish/scoopi/blob/master/src/main/resources/defs/examples/jsoup/ex-1/job.yml)

Scoopi is 5x faster than Gotz. 

- Gotz takes around 10 minutes to scrape 1000 pages where as Scoopi completes it in under 2 minutes.
